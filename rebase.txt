What is git rebase?

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.
The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history.


 For example
 consider a situation where the master branch has progressed since you started working on a feature branch.
 You want to get the latest updates to the master branch in your feature branch,
 but you want to keep your branch's history clean so it appears as if you've been working off the latest master branch.
 This gives the later benefit of a clean merge of your feature branch back into the master branch.
 Why do we want to maintain a "clean history"?
 The benefits of having a clean history become tangible when performing Git operations to investigate the
 introduction of a regression
